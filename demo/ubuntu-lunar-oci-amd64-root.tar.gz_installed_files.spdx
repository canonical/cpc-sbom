Karr\n Copyright (C)  1992 Ronald S. Karr\n Copyleft (GNU) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\nLicense: SMAIL-GPL\n                     SMAIL GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)\n .\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also\n use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n .\n   The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the\n mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is\n intended to give everyone the right to share SMAIL.  To make sure that\n you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions\n that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\n the rights.  Hence this license agreement.\n .\n   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give\n away copies of SMAIL, that you receive source code or else can get it\n if you want it, that you can change SMAIL or use pieces of it in new\n free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n .\n   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to\n deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute\n copies of SMAIL, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\n have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n source code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n .\n   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone\n finds out that there is no warranty for SMAIL.  If SMAIL is modified by\n someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\n they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced\n by others will not reflect on our reputation.\n .\n   Therefore we (Landon Curt Noll and Ronald S. Karr) make the following\n terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change\n SMAIL.\n .\n .\n                         COPYING POLICIES\n .\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of SMAIL source code\n as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice \"Copyright\n (C) 1988 Landon Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr\" (or with whatever year is\n appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this\n License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\n other recipients of the SMAIL program a copy of this License\n Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee\n for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n .\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of SMAIL or any portion of it,\n and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of\n Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n .\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n .\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,\n    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of SMAIL or\n    any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third\n    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License\n    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive\n    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n .\n    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of\n    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty\n    protection in exchange for a fee.\n .\n Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its\n derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\n the other program under the scope of these terms.\n .\n   3. You may copy and distribute SMAIL (or a portion or derivative of it,\n under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n .\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n .\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal\n    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n .\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for non-commercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n .\n For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for\n all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include\n source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the\n operating system on which the executable file runs.\n .\n   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL\n except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt\n otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer SMAIL is void and\n your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be\n automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer\n software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have\n their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n .\n   5. If you wish to incorporate parts of SMAIL into other free\n programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to Landon\n Curt Noll & Ronald S. Karr via the Free Software Foundation at 51\n Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.  We have not yet\n worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often\n permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the\n free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\n the sharing and reuse of software.\n .\n Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our\n software are welcome!  This contract was based on the contract made by\n the Free Software Foundation.  Please contact the Free Software\n Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,\n USA, or call (617) 542-5942 for details on copylefted material in\n general.\n .\n                         NO WARRANTY\n .\n   BECAUSE SMAIL IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO\n WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, LANDON CURT NOLL & RONALD S. KARR AND/OR\n OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE SMAIL \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF SMAIL IS WITH\n YOU.  SHOULD SMAIL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n .\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL LANDON CURT NOLL &\n RONALD S. KARR AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE\n SMAIL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\n (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\n PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) SMAIL, EVEN IF YOU HAVE\n BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY\n ANY OTHER PARTY.\n",

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In addition, Debian provides the gm2 compiler, either in\nthe same source package, or built from a separate same source package.\nPackaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers\n<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:\n\n  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)\n  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)\n  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)\n  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)\n\nThe current gcc-12 source package is taken from the git gcc-12-branch.\n\nChanges: See changelog.Debian.gz\n\nDebian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,\nlibrary, and documentation as follows:\n\nLanguage       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAda            gnat-12          libgnat-12          gnat-12-doc\nC              gcc-12                              gcc-12-doc\nC++            g++-12           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-12-doc\nD              gdc-12\nFortran 95     gfortran-12      libgfortran5       gfortran-12-doc\nGo             gccgo-12         libgo0\nObjective C    gobjc-12         libobjc4\nObjective C++  gobjc++-12\nModula-2       gm2-12           libgm2\n\nFor some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,\ndevelopment files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-\nindependent code in separate packages:\n\nLanguage  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nC++                                  libstdc++6-12-dbg  libstdc++6-12-pic\nD         libphobos-12-dev\n\nAdditional packages include:\n\nAll languages:\nlibgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)\ngcc-12-base                    Base files common to all compilers\ngcc-12-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)\ngcc-12-source                  The sources with patches\n\nAda:\nlibgnat-util12-dev, libgnat-util12   GNAT version library\n\nC:\ncpp-12, cpp-12-doc            GNU C Preprocessor\nlibssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library\nlibquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type\nfixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files\n\nC, C++ and Fortran 95:\nlibgomp1-dev, libgomp1\t\tGCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library\nlibitm1-dev, libitm1\t\tGNU Transactional Memory Library\n\nBiarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,\nDebian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some\nlibraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of\n'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which\ncan also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names\nbeginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit\nversions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all\nlibraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64\npackages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT STATEMENTS AND LICENSING TERMS\n\n\nGCC is Copyright (C) 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994,\n1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007,\n2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\nFree Software Foundation, Inc.\n\nGCC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later\nversion.\n\nGCC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\n  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n      the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n      No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\n============================================\n\ndoc/examples/tlsproxy/\nCopyright: Copyright (c) 2016 Wrymouth Innovation Ltd\nLicense: Expat\n Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\n copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\n to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\n the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\n and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\n Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Major\n portions are based on code by other authors; see AUTHORS for details.\n Most of the source has been put into the public domain, but some files\n have not (details below).\n .\n This file describes the source package.  The binary packages contain\n some files derived from other works: for example, images in the API\n documentation come from Doxygen.\nLicense:\n Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here\n is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\n package (but check the individual files to be sure!):\n .\n   - liblzma is in the public domain.\n .\n   - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\n     domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\n     in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under\n     GNU LGPLv2.1+.\n .\n   - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\n     adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\n     under GNU GPLv2+.\n .\n   - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\n     XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories\n     are in the public domain.\n .\n   - Translated messages are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The build system contains public domain files, and files that\n     are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\n     in the binaries being built.\n .\n   - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\n     utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\n .\n   - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\n     that are under various free software licenses.\n .\n You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into\n the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,\n take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find\n the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\n lawyers.\n .\n As usual, this software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty.\n .\n If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils\n into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\n polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\n naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\n notice to put into \"about box\" or into documentation:\n .\n     This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.\n .\n The following license texts are included in the following files:\n   - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\n   - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\n   - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\n .\n Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\n pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma\n binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety\n even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source\n package.\n .\n If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more\n information.\n\nFiles: *\nCopyright: 2006-2018, Lasse Collin\n           1999-2008, Igor Pavlov\n           2006, Ville Koskinen\n           1998, Steve Reid\n           2000, Wei Dai\n           2003, Kevin Springle\n           2009, Jonathan Nieder\n           2010, Anders F Bj\u00f6rklund\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\nComment:\n  From: Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n  To: Jonathan Nieder <jrnieder@gmail.com>\n  Subject: Re: XZ utils for Debian\n  Date: Sun, 19 Jul 2009 13:28:23 +0300\n  Message-Id: <200907191328.23816.lasse.collin@tukaani.org>\n .\n [...]\n .\n  > AUTHORS, ChangeLog, COPYING, README, THANKS, TODO,\n  > dos/README, windows/README\n .\n  COPYING says that most docs are in the public domain. Maybe that's not\n  clear enough, but on the other hand it looks a bit stupid to put\n  copyright information in tiny and relatively small docs like README.\n .\n  I don't dare to say that _all_ XZ Utils specific docs are in the public\n  domain unless otherwise mentioned in the file. I'm including PDF files\n  generated by groff + ps2pdf, and some day I might include Doxygen-\n  generated HTML docs too. Those don't include any copyright notices, but\n  it seems likely that groff + ps2pdf or at least Doxygen put some\n  copyrighted content into the generated files.\n\nFiles: INSTALL NEWS PACKAGERS\n windows/README-Windows.txt\n windows/INSTALL-MinGW.txt\nCopyright: 2009-2010, Lasse Collin\nLicense: probably-PD\n See the note on AUTHORS, README, and so on above.\n\nFiles: src/scripts/* lib/* extra/scanlzma/scanlzma.c\nCopyright: \u00a9 1993, Jean-loup Gailly\n           \u00a9 1989-1994, 1996-1999, 2001-2007, Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2006 Timo Lindfors\n           2005, Charles Levert\n           2005, 2009, Lasse Collin\n           2009, Andrew Dudman\nOther-Authors: Paul Eggert, Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: GPL-2+\n\nFiles: src/scripts/Makefile.am src/scripts/xzless.1\nCopyright: 2009, Andrew Dudman\n           2009, Lasse Collin\nLicense: PD\n This file has been put in the public domain.\n You can do whatever you want with this file.\n\nFiles: doc/examples/xz_pipe_comp.c doc/examples/xz_pipe_decomp.c\nCopyright: 2010, Daniel Mealha Cabrita\nLicense: PD\n Not copyrighted -- provided to the public domain.\n\nFiles: lib/getopt.c lib/getopt1.c lib/getopt.in.h\nCopyright: \u00a9 1987-2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Ulrich Drepper\nLicense: LGPL-2.1+\n\nFiles: m4/getopt.m4 m4/posix-shell.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2002-2006, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n           \u00a9 2007-2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nOther-Authors: Bruno Haible, Paul Eggert\nLicense: permissive-fsf\n\nFiles: m4/acx_pthread.m4\nCopyright: \u00a9 2008, Steven G.

These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of\n'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which\ncan also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names\nbeginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit\nversions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all\nlibraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64\npackages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT STATEMENTS AND LICENSING TERMS\n\n\nGCC is Copyright (C) 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994,\n1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007,\n2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\nFree Software Foundation, Inc.\n\nGCC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later\nversion.\n\nGCC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n\nlibquadmath/*.[hc]:\n\n   Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n   Written by Francois-Xavier Coudert  <fxcoudert@gcc.gnu.org>\n   Written by Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>\n\nThis file is part of the libiberty library.\nLibiberty is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nLibiberty is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR\n    DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n .\n License\n .\n THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE\n COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY\n COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\n AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n .\n BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE\n TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY\n BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\n CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\n CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions\n .\n  a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n     recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n     derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n     this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n     work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n     timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n  b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n     considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\n     License.\n  c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n     other transfer of ownership.\n  d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\n     offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n  e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n     the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n     or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in\n     addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n     musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\n     play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\n     expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\n     being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a\n     performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the\n     organization that transmits the broadcast.\n  f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\n     of this License including without limitation any production in the\n     literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\n     form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\n     of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\n     choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\n     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\n     a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the\n     extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by\n     a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\n     considered a literary or artistic work.\n  g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n     violation.\n  h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\n     to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\n     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\n     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\n     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\n     place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\n     by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\n     performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\n     broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,\n     sounds or images.\n  i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n     without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n     fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\n     protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n     medium.\n .\n 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\n limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\n limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\n copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\n exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n     Collections;\n  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n     to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The\n     original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a\n     modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n     in Collections; and,\n  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n  e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n .\n      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n         of the rights granted under this License; and,\n    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n         Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n         voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n         by You of the rights granted under this License.\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\n other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\n granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\n subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n     on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n     the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n     to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n     Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n     measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n     Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n     the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n     incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n     apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n     License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n     as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\n     Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n     practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n     Section 4(b), as requested.\n  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n     and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n     or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n     attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n     terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n     extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n     specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n     refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n     and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n     a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n     \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\n     based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by\n     this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n     provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n     a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n     authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n     credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n     other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n     in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n     Parties.\n  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n     take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n     prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\n     agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n     of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n     make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n     modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n     Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n     as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n     applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n     right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n     but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\n WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\n OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\n BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n     survive any termination of this License.\n  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n     Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n     any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n     stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n     the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n     by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n     enforceable.\n  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n     for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n     September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n     and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n     These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.

It\n does not mean licensing fees.\n .\n \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,\n or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the\n Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such\n changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n .\n \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the\n Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may\n be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n .\n \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n configuration files for the Package.\n .\n \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or\n any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation\n of the Source form.\n .\n Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n .\n (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n .\n Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n .\n (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\n your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n Compiled form of the Package.\n .\n (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\n Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n will be subject to the Original License.\n .\n Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n .\n (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the\n Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright\n Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b)\n ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the\n user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the\n Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of\n the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the\n Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version\n available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license\n that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the\n Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy\n that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the\n Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are\n allowed.\n .\n Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified\n Versions without the Source\n .\n (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be\n valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any\n time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n .\n (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the\n Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the\n Source of the Modified Version.\n .\n Aggregating or Linking the Package\n .\n (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n as included in the aggregation.\n .\n (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n .\n Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n .\n (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\n considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n terms of this license.\n .\n General Provisions\n .\n (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n license.\n .\n (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version\n made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to\n ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n this license.\n .\n (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n .\n (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n infringed by the Package.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal\n of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and\n scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for\n their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n .\n For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\n expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\n associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that\n he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,\n voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute\n the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and\n Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect\n of CC0 on those rights.\n .\n 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright\n and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\n not limited to, the following:\n .\n    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n    communicate, and translate a Work;\n .\n    moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n .\n    publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n    likeness depicted in a Work;\n .\n    rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n .\n    rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n .\n    database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC\n    of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996\n    on the legal protection of databases, and under any national\n    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version\n    of such directive); and\n .\n    other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n    thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\n of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\n irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all\n of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\n causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing\n as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\n all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by\n applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the\n Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\n detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\n Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the\n quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's\n express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\n reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,\n then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted\n taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In\n addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby\n grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non\n sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license\n to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\n in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided\n by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\n in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)\n for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,\n advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\").

This file is offered as-is, without any\n warranty.\n\nLicense: Artistic-dist\n                       The \"Artistic License\"\n .\n                              Preamble\n .\n The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\n Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\n semblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,\n while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\n the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\n reasonable modifications.\n .\n It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own\n programs without transferring this License to those programs, provided\n that you meet some reasonable requirements.\n .\n Definitions:\n .\n         \"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\n         Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\n         created through textual modification.\n .\n         \"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\n         modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\n         of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n .\n         \"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\n         copyrights for the package.\n .\n         \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\n         this Package.\n .\n         \"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\n         basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\n         and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\n         Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\n         as a market that must bear the fee.)\n .\n         \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n         itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\n         It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\n         under the same conditions they received it.\n .\n 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\n Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\n duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n .\n 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\n modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n .\n 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\n that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\n when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\n following:\n .\n     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\n     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\n     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\n     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\n     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n .\n     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n .\n     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\n     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\n     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\n     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\n executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n .\n     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\n     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\n     to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n     the Package with your modifications.\n .\n     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\n     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\n     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n .\n     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n .\n 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\n Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\n Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\n you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\n commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\n distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\n product of your own.\n .\n 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\n output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\n under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\n them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\n Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\n Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\n binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\n neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\n fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\n not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\n Package.\n .\n 7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\n you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\n to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\n copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\n clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\n license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\n connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\n You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\n choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\n context of your package.\n .\n 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\n products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n .\n 9.
